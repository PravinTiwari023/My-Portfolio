# My Portfolio Website

This project is aimed at developing a personal portfolio website using Python Flask, HTML/CSS, and PostgreSQL for the database.

## Features
- **Homepage:** Display basic information about yourself, such as your name, profession, and a brief introduction.
- **Projects:** Showcase your projects with descriptions and possibly links to GitHub repositories or live demos.
- **Contact:** Provide a way for visitors to reach out to you, such as through a contact form or direct email link.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-portfolio.git
   cd your-portfolio
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database Setup (PostgreSQL):**
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database.
   - Update the database URI in `config.py` to point to your database.

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

   Access the website at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## File Structure
Brief overview of important files and directories in the project:

- `app.py`: Main Flask application file.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for different pages.
- `static/`: Holds CSS files, images, and other static assets.

## Next Steps
For the initial version, focus on creating a simple layout with basic functionality. Here are some tasks you can start with:

- Design the homepage layout.
- Set up routes and render static content.
- Connect the backend to PostgreSQL for dynamic content (e.g., project listings).
- Implement basic navigation between pages.

## Future Enhancements
As you progress, consider adding the following features to your portfolio website:

- Dynamic project listings fetched from the database.
- Contact form with backend processing.
- User authentication for admin features (if needed).
